							 While looking for a summerjob online, I realized how tedious and uneffective the 
                             whole process was. Scouring 3-5 websites in hopes of finding someone willing to hire a freshman
                             is not easy. Mostly due to the lack of filtering.

                             Jason Fried (founder & CEO at Basecamp) said something that stuck with me for a while.

                              I decided to scratch my own itch to see if someone else shared my annoyance.
                              Thanks to the great prototyping framework <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, it didn't
                              take long before I had <a href="http://studjobb.no">Studjobb.no</a> up and running.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                              My goal was to make a simple and lazy way of receiving job postings for students.
                              After some back-and-forth I ended up with a weekly mailing list and a simple
                              table featuring the latest jobs. I also added the ability for companies to advertise
                              their positions.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                              So far I've only spread the word about the site through a couple of internal mailing lists
                              at NTNU. The service is completely automated, the only thing that remains is getting
                              the word out.

						   Paul Graham's essays are always entertaining to read. My favourite essay, which I also try 
						   to keep in the back of my head whenever a "brilliant" idea comes along, is <i>How to Get Startup Ideas</i>.
					   </p>
					   
					   <blockquote>
						   The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It's to look for problems,
						   preferably problems you have yourself.
					   </blockquote>
					   
					   <p>
						   One week ago I decided to solve a problem which has been an annoyance for a long time:
						   Referencing. Throughout high-school, being able to reference books, articles and websites is 
						   an important part of the curriculum. Failing to do so will almost certainly negativly affect
						   your grade.
					   </p>
					   
					   <p>
						   In combination with Bootstrap, Angular, a simple crawler, a MySQL-backend glued together with a REST API and
						   some good ol' elbow grease - LittList was born. LittList lets you search for books by author, title, ISBN or
						   content, in a huge database consisting of metadata for books. The student then proceeds by adding the references
						   that were used. Lastly the student clicks <i>Generate</i> and a properly formatted bibliography is returned.
					   </p>
					   
					   <p>
						   I launched the site on the evening of the 24th of November by posting the link to a couple of private Facebook Groups.
						   The response was overwhelmingly positive! I quickly received a lot of feedback regarding the
						   technical implementation and the general userinterface. It was extremely fun, not to mention addictive,
						   to monitor the traffic in realtime with Piwik, and getting appreciative e-mails. In the course of 5 days 
						   the site had received about 5.2 thousand unique visitors and over 4.8 thousand bibliographies had been generated.
					   </p>
					   
					   <p>
						   It did not take long before other websites started noticing the post on Facebook, which was rapidly gaining
						   traction (in the form of likes and comments). As a result, StudentTorget.no published an article which led
						   to even more traffic. Due to a relativly poor and inconsiderate programmed crawler, the CPU of the server
						   LittList was hosted on started to choke. Luckily, I managed to resolve the issue before crashing the entire box.
					   </p>
					   
					   <p>
						   Even though only one week has passed, it has been very rewarding to hear that LittList actually helps students
						   who are fed up with spending time formatting bibliographies. I guess writing the assignment/paper in the first place
						   is boring enough.

						   It would be an understatement to say that I'm <i>excited</i> for what my time in Trondheim
						   will bring. Being able to study Computer Science has been a long-term goal, thus being
						   accepted at NTNU is undoubtely a huge achievement for me.
					   </p>
					  
					   <p>
						   One of the first things I noticed in Trondheim was the great diversety within extracurricular
						   activites you could take part in. There is literally something for everyone. I was by coincidence
						   introduced to two programs in late September: AppLab and SPARK.
					   </p>
					   
					   <p>
						  Both of these programs aims to guide and mentor students with startup-ideas towards a
						  minimum viable product. I chose to participate in both of them, as AppLab mainly focuses on
						  building an app for mobile platforms, and SPARK provides tight follow-ups and personal advisory from 
						  an NSE-student [1].
					   </p>
					  
					   <p>
						  In retrospect I can safely say that I feel very much at home in Trondheim. Being given the opportunity 
						  to work on an idea - whether it's good or bad - is extremely rewarding and fun! It's a shame that programs
						  which try to encourage innovation only seem to be available at university. I would have loved to attend 
						  something similar in high-school.
					   </p>
					   
					   <p>
						   I'm really looking forward to the following years.
