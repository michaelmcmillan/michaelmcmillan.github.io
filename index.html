25/04/2014 - Studjobb

While looking for a summerjob online, I realized how tedious and
uneffective the whole process was. Scouring 3-5 websites in hopes of
finding someone willing to hire a freshman is not easy. Mostly due to
the lack of filtering.

Jason Fried (founder & CEO at Basecamp) said something that stuck with
me for a while.  

"[...] It's important to solve your own problems, and to recognize
that your problem is not unique." I decided to scratch my own itch to
see if someone else shared my annoyance. Thanks to the great
prototyping framework Bootstrap, it didn't take long before I had
Studjobb.no up and running.

My goal was to make a simple and lazy way of receiving job postings
for students. After some back-and-forth I ended up with a weekly
mailing list and a simple table featuring the latest jobs. I also
added the ability for companies to advertise their positions.

So far I've only spread the word about the site through a couple of
internal mailing lists at NTNU. The service is completely automated,
the only thing that remains is getting the word out.

01/12/2013 - Referencing sucks

Paul Graham's essays are always entertaining to read. My favourite
essay, which I also try to keep in the back of my head whenever a
"brilliant" idea comes along, is How to Get Startup Ideas.

"The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas.
It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself." One
week ago I decided to solve a problem which has been an annoyance for
a long time: Referencing. Throughout high-school, being able to
reference books, articles and websites is an important part of the
curriculum. Failing to do so will almost certainly negativly affect
your grade.

In combination with Bootstrap, Angular, a simple crawler, a
MySQL-backend glued together with a REST API and some good ol' elbow
grease - LittList was born.  LittList lets you search for books by
author, title, ISBN or content, in a huge database consisting of
metadata for books. The student then proceeds by adding the references
that were used. Lastly the student clicks Generate and a properly
formatted bibliography is returned.

I launched the site on the evening of the 24th of November by posting
the link to a couple of private Facebook Groups. The response was
overwhelmingly positive! I quickly received a lot of feedback
regarding the technical implementation and the general userinterface.
It was extremely fun, not to mention addictive, to monitor the traffic
in realtime with Piwik, and getting appreciative e-mails. In the
course of 5 days the site had received about 5.2 thousand unique
visitors and over 4.8 thousand bibliographies had been generated.

It did not take long before other websites started noticing the post
on Facebook, which was rapidly gaining traction (in the form of likes
and comments). As a result, StudentTorget.no published an article
which led to even more traffic. Due to a relativly poor and
inconsiderate programmed crawler, the CPU of the server LittList was
hosted on started to choke. Luckily, I managed to resolve the issue
before crashing the entire box.

Even though only one week has passed, it has been very rewarding to
hear that LittList actually helps students who are fed up with
spending time formatting bibliographies. I guess writing the
assignment/paper in the first place is boring enough.

27/11/13 - Trondheim

It would be an understatement to say that I'm excited for what my time
in Trondheim will bring. Being able to study Computer Science has been
a long-term goal, thus being accepted at NTNU is undoubtely a huge
achievement for me.

One of the first things I noticed in Trondheim was the great diversety
within extracurricular activites you could take part in. There is
literally something for everyone. I was by coincidence introduced to
two programs in late September: AppLab and SPARK.

Both of these programs aims to guide and mentor students with
startup-ideas towards a minimum viable product. I chose to participate
in both of them, as AppLab mainly focuses on building an app for
mobile platforms, and SPARK provides tight follow-ups and personal
advisory from an NSE-student [1].

In retrospect I can safely say that I feel very much at home in
Trondheim.  Being given the opportunity to work on an idea - whether
it's good or bad - is extremely rewarding and fun! It's a shame that
programs which try to encourage innovation only seem to be available
at university. I would have loved to attend something similar in
high-school.

I'm really looking forward to the following years.
