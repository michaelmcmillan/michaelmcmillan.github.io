It would be an understatement to say that I'm excited for what my time
in Trondheim will bring. Being able to study Computer Science has been
a long-term goal, thus being accepted at NTNU is undoubtely a huge
achievement for me.

One of the first things I noticed in Trondheim was the great diversety
within extracurricular activites you could take part in. There is
literally something for everyone. I was by coincidence introduced to
two programs in late September: AppLab and SPARK.

Both of these programs aims to guide and mentor students with
startup-ideas towards a minimum viable product. I chose to participate
in both of them, as AppLab mainly focuses on building an app for
mobile platforms, and SPARK provides tight follow-ups and personal
advisory from an NSE-student [1].

In retrospect I can safely say that I feel very much at home in
Trondheim.  Being given the opportunity to work on an idea - whether
it's good or bad - is extremely rewarding and fun! It's a shame that
programs which try to encourage innovation only seem to be available
at university. I would have loved to attend something similar in
high-school.

I'm really looking forward to the following years.
