While looking for a summerjob online, I realized how tedious and
uneffective the whole process was. Scouring 3-5 websites in hopes of
finding someone willing to hire a freshman is not easy. Mostly due to
the lack of filtering.

Jason Fried (founder and CEO at Basecamp) said something that stuck with
me for a while.  

"[...] It's important to solve your own problems, and to recognize
that your problem is not unique." I decided to scratch my own itch to
see if someone else shared my annoyance. Thanks to the great
prototyping framework Bootstrap, it didn't take long before I had
Studjobb.no up and running.

My goal was to make a simple and lazy way of receiving job postings
for students. After some back-and-forth I ended up with a weekly
mailing list and a simple table featuring the latest jobs. I also
added the ability for companies to advertise their positions.

So far I've only spread the word about the site through a couple of
internal mailing lists at NTNU. The service is completely automated,
the only thing that remains is getting the word out.
