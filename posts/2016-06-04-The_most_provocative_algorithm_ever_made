You'd think that playing music without skippping would be something
users would demand from Spotify. Seriosuly, how hard can it be to get
this right? An analog record player does this without missing a beat
(pun belabored). 

However, judging by the sheer rage ciculating forums and comment
sections online, it seems their users are orders of magnitude more
upset over their shuffe algorithm.

These are some of the comments in an ascending order of rage. 

    "For the past couple of weeks I'll skip the same song repeated 1-2
    in a string of about 10 songs, out of 4000+ from my starred list."

    "I've had the same song from my 1,100 track starred list play
    twice in my 35 minute commute."

    "Just did a quick test and my playlist of 48 tracks will only play
    10 of the same songs over and over again and none of the other
    songs."

    "I've noticed this and am convinced that random isn't random. I
    imagine their random is actually a profit maximization model."

    "I listen to playlists with about 100 songs and with shuffle on,
    it will regularly repeat songs and only play a select number of
    songs instead of going through the whole playlist. This is with
    repeat off. A song will literally repeat after it has just played
    for goodness sake, something isn't right here.."

    "Are you fucking kidding me spotify? This whole article? How about
    another is played a second time! I've had premium over a year. You
    guys are ass."

So what is going on? At first I chalked this up to the Gamblers
Fallacy [1].  WIRED wrote an article explaining why true
randomness is clustered, and not evenly distributed like most people
intuit. This is the same reason the Brits mistakenly assumed
that the Germans had an exceptionally good aim with their V-1 flying
bombs during World War II [2].

With that said, I have a hard time seeing how the engineers at Spotify
could mess this up. Shuffle is basically self-explanatory, especially
if you've ever held a deck of cards. To shuffle a playlist you simply
change the order of the songs randomly, just like you would when playing
a card game.

I rarely activate shuffle on my own playlists, which made it hard to
confirm the alleged shortcomings above. Fortunately it is quite easy
to interact with the user interface using AppleScript.

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    function spotify {
        osascript -e "tell application \"Spotify\" to $*"
    }

    function play_all_the_songs {
        for i in {1..100}
        do
            spotify next track
            ARTIST=`spotify artist of current track`
            TRACK=`spotify name of current track`
            printf "%s - %s\n" "$ARTIST" "$TRACK"
        done
    }

    if [[ $1 = "continous" ]]; then
        spotify set shuffling to false
    elif [[ $1 = "shuffle" ]]; then
        spotify set shuffling to true
    fi

    play_all_the_songs

The script above presumes that you have Spotify running and a playlist
containg 100 unique songs opened. It plays through the entire playlist
and writes the name of the artist and the song name of the current
track to stdout. The first argument determines if shuffle should be
activated or not.

    $ ./listen-through-playlist.sh continous
    Paolo Nutini - New Shoes
    Radiohead - Creep
    The Cars - Drive
    Kendrick Lamar - Backseat Freestyle
    [...]

It is trivial to assert that the playlist in fact shuffles the music
without playing any song more than once. Simply diff the output from a
continous run against a shuffled run. They contain the same tracks.

    $ diff <(./listen.sh continous | sort) <(./listen.sh shuffle | sort) --report-identical-files
    Files /dev/fd/11 and /dev/fd/12 are identical
    
The claim that a song is played more than once, effectively
duplicating it in the queue, is false. In other words, Spotify
is undeservingly on the receiving end of a shit storm caused
by a failure of intution.
